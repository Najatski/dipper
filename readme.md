## What is this?
This is a python script that I somehow managed to throw together, which allows the PlayStation PDP Riffmaster's vendor-defined whammy and tilt functionality to work in Clone Hero â€” and any other app if you really want. Why this hasn't been done until now (except for natively in [YARG](https://yarg.in/)), I am not sure.
