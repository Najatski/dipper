## What is this?
This is a python script that I somehow managed to throw together, which allows the PlayStation PDP Riffmaster's vendor-defined whammy and tilt functionality to work in Clone Hero â€” and any other app if you really want. Why this hasn't been done until now (except for natively in [YARG](https://yarg.in/)), I am not sure.

## Dependencies
* Python 3.12 (add to PATH)
  * `hidapi` module
  * `pyvjoy` module
* vJoy

Once you've installed python, open powershell and run:
`pip install hidapi pyvjoy`

In theory, it should maybe, just maybe run in the state of which it is in.
